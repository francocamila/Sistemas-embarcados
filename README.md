# Anime Drink 5000

This repository was created for the Sistemas Embarcados class and contains a program of a drink machine that has 2 options of drinks and after serving the chosen drink it takes 4 photos of the user, makes a GIF and posts it on Tumblr. The code was made in C language and Python, to be implemented in a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.

Access to the GIFs:
